        KIEV — The European Union warned Ukraine on Thursday time was running out to
        revive shelved deals on free trade and political association by meeting the bloc\'s
        concerns over the jailing of opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko and bringing in
        reforms.

        A senior EU official also made it clear the agreements would fall through if Ukraine
        joined the Russia-led post-Soviet Customs Union trade bloc. "We have a window of
        opportunity. But time is short,'' Stefan Fuele, the European Commissioner for
        Enlargement and European Neighbourhood Policy, said on a visit to Ukraine.

        Brussels put off signing the landmark agreements after a Ukrainian court jailed former
        prime minister Tymoshenko, President Viktor Yanukovich's main opponent, on an abuseof-office
        charge in October 2011.

        The EU says the Tymoshenko case and those of other prosecuted opposition politicians
        are examples of selective justice and are a barrier to Ukraine's ambition of European
        integration.

        Two other issues raised by the bloc are related to the electoral system, which came
        under fire from Western observers following the parliamentary election in October, and
        legal reforms needed to bring Ukraine closer to EU standards.
